		<pre><b>Identifier</b> - anytime when you get to name something (class, variable, etc.)
has to start with a letter, dollar sign, or underscore, and then it can be followed by anything

<b>Keywords</b> - Reserved words with predefined meanings

Whitespace characters - include space, tab, newline (carriage return)

Token - some string of text thats considered a unit (between whitespaces)

Declaring variables - String word;

Initializing variables - Put the 1st value into it (word = "Hello)

Assign(ment) - putting the value into the variable; typically when the value of the       variable is changed after the initialization

Constant variable - value can't change

Statement - a line of code ended by a semi-colon

Expression - a chunk of code that produces a value

Casting - Implicit when you don't have to specify the change of the data type
               Explicit when you have to specify data type (i.e. (int))

break - immediately breaks from the block of code you're in (loop)
continue - proceed to end of closest loop

Concatenate - to join a string with another string or data type, use a plus sign (+). Whenever possible, Java automatically converts the data type and joins it with the string.

Immutable - Cannot be changed

Instance - Student firstStudent = new Student();

Fields (Instance Variables) - public, private, protected, package-protected (you can use it if in same folder) DEFAULT

Instance Variable - Variables for the instance of a class (primarily used) class Instance.variable name - belongs to class, but not in a method

Instance Methods -  are associated with the objects, and as the name implies, can use instance variables

Static method -  One rule-of-thumb: ask yourself "does it make sense to call this method, even if no Obj has been constructed yet?" If so, it should definitely be static.
So in a class Car you might have a method double convertMpgToKpl(double mpg) which would be static, because one might want to know what 35mpg converts to, even if nobody has ever built a Car. But void setMileage(double mpg) (which sets the efficiency of one particular Car) can't be static since it's inconceivable to call the method before any Car has been constructed.

Class Variable - (static) Class.variable name; static - doesn't require an instance

Collection - Similar to an array ... an object that can hold one or more elements; classes available from the Java API

Generics - specifications of the element type for a collection

Primitive types - int, doubles, boolean, longs, shorts

<b>Object-Oriented Programming</b>

	* Abstraction - taking a complex thing and perceiving it as something simple
	* Encapsulation - classes, methods & variables (Student class combines all features in one object) - Wrapping related functionality and data together in one unit
	* Inheritance - A class acquiring properties and behaviors of parent class; provides code reusability
	* Polymorphism - the same task can be done in different ways depending on the object's type.; also the ability of an object to take on many forms (Person: Employee, Student)


Protected - some classes have access, but not all classes; specifically only classes that extend the super class; as well as classes within the same package
Default - only other classes that are in the exact same package

Final - In a method cannot be overwritten; in a variable cannot be changed; in a class cannot be inherited

Abstract - (class or method) - can be inherited by other classes, but not used to create an actual object; used for vanilla parent classes

Test Driven Development (TDD): Think about all test case scenarios; Write them out; Translate into code (@Test public void)Implementation; run tests; refactor
     Test Case - one expectation of your application/module (setup/execute/verify)
When_Expect_ (template for test methods)

<b>Interfaces</b> - WHAT: only has abstract instance methods AND static constants; cannot be instantiated; a class can implement any number of interfaces (multiple inheritance); the class MUST implement all methods of the interface; WHY: multiple inheritance: a class can implement multiple; a contract ... the class is guaranteed to have certain methods

<b>Exceptions:</b> Checked Exceptions - you must catch (i.e. IOExceptions); Unchecked Exceptions - java doesn't care if you catch or not (i.e. InputMismatch)

Threads - 

<b>CSS Selector</b> -  The selector instructs the browser to search the page for any HTML element that matches the given criteria. It applies any applicable declarations to that element
